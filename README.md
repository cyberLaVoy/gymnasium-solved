# openai-gym

Welcome to my personal project on reinforcement learning! This repository contains solutions to OpenAI's Gym problems using deep reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithms.

The code in this repository is written in Python and includes both single-threaded and multi-threaded implementations. I created this project to learn about reinforcement learning and see its capabilities firsthand. With this repository, you can train your own agents and experiment with deep reinforcement learning and Q-learning on a variety of environments, including Atari games, classic-control, and toy-text.

## Features
- Explore deep reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithms and their performance on various environments
-  Train agents to solve complex Atari games using multi-threading
- Use the code as a starting point for your own reinforcement learning projects

## Setup
The setup process to run the code in this repository is currently complex and the documentation is not ready. But don't worry, setup documentation will be coming soon!

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
